MySQL Notifier 1.1.8 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL Notifier 1.1.8

* Connections to MySQL Server 8.0 using strong password authentication (via the caching_sha2_password authentication plugin) are now supported.
* Connections using SSL are now supported. These connections may be created from MySQL Workbench or directly in MySQL Notifier
* SSH tunneled connections are also supported now, the tunnel is created automatically and no need to have an intermediate software to create
  the tunnel, just the way also MySQL Workbench transparently works.
* Fixed the display of an unhandled exception when the user does not accept the UAT dialog shown when launching MySQL Installer. If the user
  cancels nothing happens, but if any other exception happens when launching it is displayed to users and logged.
* Changed the "Automatically check for MySQL updates" option to perform the check every X days instead of weeks, this offers a better frequency
  for users. The valid values for the option are between 1 and 365. Any previously saved value will be automatically converted from weeks to
  days when launching a version of MySQL Notifer >= 1.1.8. Changed the behavior of the "Check for Updates..." menu item to immediately query
  MySQL Installer for updates on products, in the same way the scheduled task queries MySQL Installer for updates, instead of just launching
  MySQL Installer. NOTE: Checking for updates needs MySQL Installer to be upgraded to the version 1.4.31 or greater.
* Added logic to automatically add a monitored MySQL Instance for a locally running MySQL Router Windows service when MySQL Notifier starts.
  Also changed the behavior when automatically adding local MySQL Windows services to the monitoring list so every time Notifier is started
  it checks if it needs to add newly added MySQL Windows services, as opposed to past behavior when this was done only the very first time
  MySQL Notifer was run.
* Fixed a bug in the detection of the "Run at Windows startup" setting and also a bug in the Options dialog that was applying changes even
  when cancelling the dialog.
* Fixed the way MySQL Workbench is being opened to use a double-dash when using its command line options, so that it is opened on the right
  server configuration page if an entry in Workbench's server_instances.xml file matches the service or instance being monitored.
* Changed the behavior of the "Add..." button of the "Manage Items" dialog, so when clicked it calls either the "Add Service" or the "Monitor
  MySQL Server Instance" dialog depending on the currently selected tab page "Services" or "Instances". This is a more intuitive UX and removes
  the need to click a context menu option when clicking "Add...".


MySQL Notifier 1.1.7 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL Notifier 1.1.7

* Enhanced the logic that migrates stored MySQL connections to the MySQL Workbench connections.xml file. In previous versions the migration was
  offered and if not done at that moment, the dialog to migrate was shown again periodically, but there was no way to choose to remain storing
  MySQL connections in the Notifier's configuration folder instead of merging them with the Workbench ones. Now the connections migration dialog
  offers a way to postpone the migration 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month or indefinitely. If the migration is postponed the dialog is shown again
  after that time elapses, although if it is postponed indefinitely an option was added to the Options dialog that permits the migration of
  connections to be done manually, as long as MySQL Workbench is installed.
* Fixed the way MySQL Server connections and servers information is loaded during the initialization of the MySQL Notifier.
* Fixed code that checks if a Windows Service to be monitored is actually one for a MySQL Server. Previous checks were relying on the Windows
  Registry which is only valid for local computers. For remote computers the information can be queried through WMI.
* Fixed the regular expression used for the user names validation so that a user name in a "<domain>\<username>" format is treated as valid.
  Updated the regular expressions that validate a host name or IP address as well.
* Fixed the WMI query that retrieves the Windows Services in a local or remote computer to filter by the class appropriate to services shown in
  the Windows Services console.
* Fixed code so that when a new Windows Service for a MySQL Server is added, its name is recognized with its casing as is.
* Added code to let users retry the loading of a connections information XML file, and re-create the file from scratch if loading fails. This is
  in case the connections.xml file gets corrupted for any reason. The only way to get the "Root element is missing" error is if the XML file
  got corrupted.
* Fixed code so that the initialization of the errors handler is initialized before any code that uses it.



MySQL Notifier 1.1.6 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL Notifier 1.1.6

* Changed the way Notifier loaded local instances information making that process now independent from my.ini files.
* Changed the way Notifier detected changes in the Workbench connections file. This fixes the problem of not removing connections that were deleted
  from workbench and still apeared in notifier. Now we perform a data scrubbing so that list excludes connections that were deleted in workbench.
* Changed the way Notifier auto adds services to the monitored list, now the Notifier verifies if a potencial MySql service (one that matches the
  name filter criteria) is running from one of the mysql executable files, Demonstrating it is a real MySql service.
* Check for updates functionality has been fixed, Notifier is now able to check for updates periodically thru the creation of system task.
  This functionality was reported to be broken in previous versions of notifier.



MySQL Notifier 1.1.5 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL Notifier 1.1.5

* Edition of MySQL Workbench connections right from the Monitor MySQL Server Instance window of the MySQL Notifier (accessed through Actions
  > Manage Monitored Items... > Add... > MySQL Instance). Any of the listed MySQL Workbench connections can be right-clicked and a new "Edit
  Connection" context menu is available for users to edit the Workbench connection properties.  This feature shines brighter when MySQL
  Workbench is not installed since users only relied on MySQL Workbench to edit a connection, without Workbench users had to delete a 
  connection and create it again with updated values.
* When there were MySQL instances being monitored at Notifier created from a Workbench connection,  if they were deleted using MySQL Workbench
  the connections would not be removed from the Notifier until a manual restart. These external changes to the connections file are now being
  monitored automatically and MySQL instances refreshed accordingly.
* Changed the way the Workbench connections and servers files are monitored, now the Notifier detects automatically when Workbench is installed
  or uninstalled and starts or stops monitoring its files on those events so the Notifier does not need to be restarted to setup the monitoring
  of the files.



MySQL Notifier 1.1.4 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL Notifier 1.1.4

* Monitoring of services in remote Windows computers through WMI (see 'WMI Configuration' below this section for details).
  - Remote services can be started, stopped and restarted (just as local services on MySQL Notifier 1.0).
	- Balloon notifications are displayed for each monitored remote service status change (just as local services on MySQL Notifier 1.0)
  - Monitored services (local and remote) are grouped and saved by machine.
  - Windows services are automatically added in any monitored machine (localhost or remote) as long as the service names contain the text
    specified in the "Automatically add new services whose name contains:" option. By default this option is set to "mysql".
  - Remote Machines status are checked regularly (via a configurable timer) to generate notifications about machines going online/offline.
* Monitoring of MySQL Instances (multi-platform) via a configurable timer.
  - Instances can be monitored by selecting existing MySQL Workbench connections and balloon notifications are displayed for each
	  monitored instance status change.
  - MySQL Workbench connections are maintained directly in MySQL Workbench files if installed or in MySQL Notifer files otherwise, and
	  are migrated to MySQL Workbench when it is installed.
	- Monitored instances display the SQL Editor and Configure Instance menus (as similar local services do) and the connection used to
	  monitor the instance is displayed in bold.
	- MySQL Notifier is launched right after installed and on every restart. This behavior can be changed through the options Window.

Known Limitations
--------------------
* MySQL Workbench-related menus (SQL Editor and Configure Instance) are not available for monitored remote services.
  Workaround: Open MySQL Workbench and select the connection of the monitored remote service.
* MySQL Workbench connections used to monitor MySQL instances cannot be edited, just added or deleted.
  Workaround: Open MySQL Workbench and edit the desired connection.



MySQL Notifier 1.0.3 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL Notifier 1.0.3

MySQL Notifier provides the following features:
* Runs in the notification area
* Monitors any service
* Allows easy access to start/stop/restart services
* Notifies you of running state changes on the services
* Provides easy access to edit and configure options for MySQL services
* Integrates with MySQL Workbench
* Integrate seamless with MySQL Installer to inform you of updates to your products

Known Issues
--------------------
* All Windows - Selecting SQL Editor from a MySQL service that doesn't have a Workbench connection opens Workbench in the home screen.
  Workaround: Create a local connection in Workbench with the MySQL service used in the Notifier so the SQL Editor could use this connection.
* Windows XP - The Scheduled Task created by the Notifier to Check for Updates does not have valid credentials and cannot be run.
  Workaround: Update the "MySQLNotifierTask" in Windows XP with some valid credentials.
