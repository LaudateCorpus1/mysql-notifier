1.1.8
- SSH tunneled connections can now be created within MySQL Notifier or pulled from MySQL Workbench to be monitored.
  (MySQL Bug #87079, Bug #26446338 - HIGH SEVERITY ERROR ON MYSQL NOTIFIER - UNHANDLED EXCEPTIONMETHOD NOT FOUND)
- Fixed the display of an unhandled exception when the user does not accept the UAT dialog shown when launching MySQL Installer. If the user
  cancels nothing happens, but if any other exception happens when launching it is displayed to users and logged.
  (MySQL Bug #86738, Bug #26301469 - UNHANDLED EXCEPTION)
- Added logic to automatically add a monitored MySQL Instance for a locally running MySQL Router Windows service when MySQL Notifier starts.
  Also changed the behavior when automatically adding local MySQL Windows services to the monitoring list so every time Notifier is started
  it checks if it needs to add newly added MySQL Windows services, as opposed to past behavior when this was done only the very first time
  MySQL Notifer was run. (MySQL Bug #91518, Bug #28277456 - MYSQL NOTIFIER DOES NOT LIST ROUTER SERVICES)
- Fixed a bug in the detection of the "Run at Windows startup" setting and also a bug in the Options dialog that was applying changes even
  when cancelling the dialog. (MySQL Bug #95250, Bug #29740645 - MYSQL NOTIFIER OPTIONS RUN AT WINDOWS STARTUP OPTION ISSUE)
- Fixed the way MySQL Workbench is being opened to use a double-dash when using its command line options, so that it is opened on the right
  server configuration page if an entry in Workbench's server_instances.xml file matches the service or instance being monitored.
  (MySQL Bug #95715, Bug #29891284 - MANAGE INSTANCE OPTION DOES NOT OPEN WORKBENCH ON THE RIGHT PAGE)
- Changed the behavior of the "Add..." button of the "Manage Items" dialog, so when clicked it calls either the "Add Service" or the "Monitor
  MySQL Server Instance" dialog depending on the currently selected tab page "Services" or "Instances". This is a more intuitive UX and removes
  the need to click a context menu option when clicking "Add...".
  (MySQL Bug #95638, Bug #29868378 - ADD AND DELETE BUTTON IN MANAGE ITEMS DIALOG ARE NOT CONSISTENT)

1.1.7
- Enhanced the logic that migrates stored MySQL connections to the MySQL Workbench connections.xml file. In previous versions the migration was
  offered and if not done at that moment, the dialog to migrate was shown again periodically, but there was no way to choose to remain storing
  MySQL connections in the Notifier's configuration folder instead of merging them with the Workbench ones. Now the connections migration dialog
  offers a way to postpone the migration 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month or indefinitely. If the migration is postponed the dialog is shown again
  after that time elapses, although if it is postponed indefinitely an option was added to the Options dialog that permits the migration of
  connections to be done manually, as long as MySQL Workbench is installed.
- Fixed the way MySQL Server connections and servers information is loaded during the initialization of the MySQL Notifier.
  (MySQL Bug #82130, Bug #23748734 - "SQL EDITOR..." OPTION IS ALWAYS DISABLED)
- Fixed code that checks if a Windows Service to be monitored is actually one for a MySQL Server. Previous checks were relying on the Windows
  Registry which is only valid for local computers. For remote computers the information can be queried through WMI.
  (MySQL Bug #75319, Bug #20389122 - MYSQL NOTIFIER 1.1.6 HIGH SEVERITY ERROR WHEN ACCESSING REMOTE SERVERS)
- Fixed the regular expression used for the user names validation so that a user name in a "<domain>\<username>" format is treated as valid.
  Updated the regular expressions that validate a host name or IP address as well.
  (MySQL Bug #82120, Bug #23746334 - DOMAIN USERS TREATED AS INVALID WHEN ADDING REMOTE WINDOWS SERVICES)
- Fixed the hardcoding of MySQLForExcel in the custom settings provider so its main XML element is named after the Application Name ("MySQLNotifier").
  Added indentation to inner elements in the configuration file.
  (MySQL Bug #82104, Bug #23740262 - NOTIFIER SETTINGS FILE MAIN XML ELEMENT CALLED MYSQLFOREXCEL)
- Fixed the WMI query that retrieves the Windows Services in a local or remote computer to filter by the class appropriate to services shown in
  the Windows Services console. (MySQL Bug #82000, Bug #23667056 - UNHANDLED EXCEPTION THROWN WHEN LISTING REMOTE SERVICES)
- Fixed code so that when a new Windows Service for a MySQL Server is added, its name is recognized with its casing as is.
  (MySQL Bug #74516, Bug #19881188 - WINDOWS SERVICE NOT RECOGNIZED BY MYSQL NOTIFIER)
- Added code to let users retry the loading of a connections information XML file, and re-create the file from scratch if loading fails. This is
  in case the connections.xml file gets corrupted for any reason. The only way to get the "Root element is missing" error is if the XML file
  got corrupted. (MySQL Bug #73540, Bug #22160640 - HIGH SEVERITY ERROR: ROOT ELEMENT IS MISSING)
- Fixed code so that the initialization of the errors handler is initialized before any code that uses it.
  (Bug #17825477 - LOG FILE PATH MAST BE DEFINED BEFORE CALLING THE WRITETOLOG METHOD ERROR)
- Fixed code that tests a connection and WMI service subscription to a remote machine that was giving a false positive in some scenarios. Also
  changed the "Add New Machine" dialog so the connection to the remote machine is tested before the OK button is enabled.
  (Bug #24305736 - NOTIFIER SHOWS AN ERROR WHEN A REMOTE SERVER SERVICE IS ADDED)

1.1.6
- Added extra validation to avoid High Severity Error while restarting when watched MySQL products were uninstalled while Notifier was not running.
  (MySQL Bug #73576, Bug #19439604 - NOTIFIER THROWS ERROR ON RESTART WHEN UNINSTALLING EVERY OTHER MYSQL PRODUCT)
- Added extra condition to handle the case where the my.ini file doesn't exist so no High Severity Exception error is thrown.
  (MySQL Bug #73539, Bug #19422802 - HIGH SEVERITY ERROR IF SERVER\'S MY.INI FILE IS DELETED)
- Added further validation to ensure only true MySQL services are added to the watched list.
  (MySQL Bug #73135, Bug #19078684 - MYSQL NOTIFIER OPENS AND GIVES AN ERROR MESSAGE "HIGH SEVERITY ERROR")
- Fixed error that prevented notifier from showing the balloon when updates are available.
  (Bug #19219905 - FAILS TO SHOW UPDATES WHEN UPDATES ARE AVAILABLE)
- Fixed code that detected changes in the Workbench connections file to clear connections before attempting to load them again from disk.
  (Bug #18163378 - REMOVED CONNECTIONS NOT DETECTED FOR SQL EDITOR...)
- Added error handling code during the check for updates process. If the user cancels the UAC prompt (since the check for updates process requires
  elevation) that is treated as an error, all errors are properly sent to the application log now.
  (Bug #17858917 - IN CHECK FOR UPDATES. IF CLICK "CANCEL" ON UAC, RAISE AN "HIGH SEVERITY ERROR")

1.1.5
- Changed the way the Workbench connections and servers files are monitored, now the Notifier detects automatically when Workbench is installed or
  uninstalled and starts or stops monitoring its files on those events so the Notifier does not need to be restarted to setup the monitoring of the
  files.
- Fixed code that attempted to reflect changes done to a connection being used by a monitored MySQL Instance after adding new Workbench connections.
  (Bug #17697914 - CHECK ADD INSTANCE LIST AND CLICK "CANCEL", RAISE ERROR)
- Added code to refresh MySQL instances when the Notifier is loading so if Workbench was uninstalled and there were instances pointing to now invalid
  connections, they are removed and the menu items do not appear empty.
  (Bug #17671410 - NOTIFIER DOES NOT UPDATE INSTANCES EXISTED IN WORKBENCH WHEN REMOVING WORKBENCH)
- Added Workbench connections edition capability right from the Monitor MySQL Server Instance window of the MySQL Notifier (accessed through Actions
  > Manage Monitored Items… > Add… > MySQL Instance). Any of the listed MySQL Workbench connections can be right-clicked and a new “Edit
  Connection” context menu is available for users to edit the Workbench connection properties.
- Fixed a problem in which MySQL Service menu options (Configure Instance and SQL Editor submenus) were not refreshed correctly when the Workbench
  connections tied to them were changed on MySQL Workbench.
- Simplified method signatures at MySQL.Utility and updated every call to them at notifier. Moved method call to create the schedule task properly.
  (Bug #14388579 - SCHEDULED TASK TO CHECK FOR UPDATES DOESN'T START IN XP)
- Removed AssemblyInfo.cs from Notifier since this class is now shared from Utility dll.
- When the user deletes the .ini file for any server at c:\ProgramData\MySQL Server 5.X\ and somewhat the services is not deleted when uninstalling that
  server, it causes the app to crash. This fix adds an additional check to verify such .ini files exist before attempting to get some values out of them.
  (Bug #17432516 - MYSQL NOTIFIER OPENS AND GIVES AN ERROR MESSAGE "HIGH SEVERITY ERROR")

1.1.4
- Fixed code to auto launch notifier right after installing it. (Bug #16927045 - AUTOSTART NOTIFIER AFTER SUCCESSFULL INSTALLATION)
- Corrected code to set the registry key to start Notifier along with Windows. (MySQL bug #69279, Bug #16832752 - MYSQL NOTIFIER: DOES NOT START WITH WINDOWS, 
  INCORRECT SETTING WITHIN REGISTER.)
  (Bug #14400738 - RUN AT WINDOWS STARTUP OPTION IS NOT WORKING)
- Fixed code to automatically add matching services. (MySql bug #67617, Bug #15887501 - MySQL Notifier autofilter not auto finding running services)
  (Bug#16660623 - NOTIFIER IS NOT LISTING THE JUST INSTALLED SERVER INSTANCE)
  (Bug#14345177 - NEW SERVICE IS NOT ADDED TO NOTIFIER)
- Fixed the SQL Editor menu to be enabled if there is only1 connection related to the current service, if there are no connections the menu item is disabled.
  (Bug#14332402 - CLICKING "SQL EDITOR" DOESN'T ACTUALLY OPEN SQL EDITOR IN WB)
- Added a custom action to the WIX project to send a WM_CLOSE message to the Notifier at uninstall time, for it to catch it and close.
  (Bug#16661468 - NOTIFIER PROCESS/APPLICATION IS STILL RUNNING AFTER UNINSTALL.)

1.1.2
- From now on if you have the AutoAddServicesToMonitor option checked and you add a new service which Name matches the filter ("mysql") in a monitored 
  machine (localhost is monitored by default) it will be automatically added to the list of monitored services.
  (MySql bug #67617, Bug #15887501 - MYSQL NOTIFIER AUTOFILTER NOT AUTO FINDING RUNNING SERVICES)
  (Bug#16660623 - NOTIFIER IS NOT LISTING THE JUST INSTALLED SERVER INSTANCE.)
  (Bug#14345177 - NEW SERVICE IS NOT ADDED TO NOTIFIER)
- Fixed code to enable the SQL Editor menu when MySQL Workbench is installed and it supports opening the SQL Editor from the command line and the bound
  service contains Workbench connections, otherwise disable it. The SQL Editor menu opens Workbench directly if only 1 connection exists and the menu is
  disabled if there are none. (Bug #14332402 - CLICKING "SQL EDITOR" DOESN'T ACTUALLY OPEN SQL EDITOR IN WB)
